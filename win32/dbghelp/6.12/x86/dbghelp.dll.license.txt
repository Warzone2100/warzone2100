These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For additional information, see

8.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
9.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based 
services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support 
services.
10.	APPLICABLE LAW.
a.	United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs 
the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
laws principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under 
state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
b.	Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that 
country apply.
11.	LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights under the 
laws of your country.  You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the 
software.  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of 
your country do not permit it to do so.
12.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.   The software is licensed “as-is.”  You bear the risk of using 
it.  Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.  You may have 
additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.  To

13.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.   You can recover from 
Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.  You cannot recover any 
other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental 
damages.
This limitation applies to
*	anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or 
third party programs; and
*	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, 
or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The 
above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel 
dommage.  Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages 
indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne 
s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
EFFET JURIDIQUE.  Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits 
prévus par les lois de votre pays.  Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de 
votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
