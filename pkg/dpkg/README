To make Debian packages of the main game, do the following from the root of the
source tree:

ln -s pkg/dpkg debian
dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc

The second step might need additional packages to be installed, it should tell
you which.

After that you'll have three packages, warzone2100, warzone2100-data and
warzone2100-music in the parent folder. The music package is not necessary to
play. Install them as root with "dpkg -i warzone*.deb".


For the videos, download the sequences.wz you want from
https://wz2100.net/download, put it into pkg/dpkg/video, then run
"dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b" from that folder.


NOTE: These packages will override your repository's Warzone packages, if you
install these, you'll have to update manually.
