# Building Warzone for macOS

## Prerequisites:

> For convenience, you will probably want either [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [Macports](https://www.macports.org/install.php) installed for setting up certain prerequisites. If you don't have either yet, **Homebrew** is recommended.

1. **macOS 10.12+**
    - While building may work on prior versions of macOS, it is only tested on macOS 10.12+.

2. **Xcode 8 / 9**
    - If you do not have Xcode 8.3+ you can get it for free at the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or [Apple's website](http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html).

3. **CMake 3.11.3+** (required to generate the Xcode project)
    - If you do not have CMake 3.11+, you can [download the latest stable version for free at CMake.org](https://cmake.org/download/#latest).

4. **Gettext** (required to compile the translations and language files)
    - If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can use the following command in Terminal:
        ```shell
        brew install gettext
        ```
        > The build scripts work perfectly with the default (keg-only) Homebrew install of gettext.
    - If you have [Macports](https://www.macports.org/install.php) installed, you can use the following command in Terminal:
        ```shell
        sudo port install gettext
        ```

5. **Asciidoctor** (required to build the documentation / help files)
    - If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can use the following command in Terminal:
        ```shell
        brew install asciidoctor
        ```
    - If you have [Macports](https://www.macports.org/install.php) installed, you can use the following command in Terminal:
        ```shell
        sudo port install asciidoctor
        ```
    - Or, via `gem install`:
        ```shell
        gem install asciidoctor --no-rdoc --no-ri --no-document
        ```
        > Depending on system configuration, `sudo gem install` may be required.

    > Alternatively, you can install + use AsciiDoc via `brew install asciidoc docbook-xsl`.


## Setup & Configuration:

Generating the macOS port's build environment & configuration requires the following steps in **Terminal**: 

### 1. Set the minimum deployment target

To set the minimum deployment target used for _vcpkg_ **and** the CMake-generated Xcode project,
execute the following command in the same Terminal session used for later commands:

1. Export minimum deployment target (example: macOS 10.9):
   ```shell
   export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9
   ```

### 2. Use _vcpkg_ to fetch & build dependencies

1. `cd` into the root folder of the Git repo / source code.
    This should be the folder *containing* `get-dependencies_mac.sh`

2. Run the following command:
   ```shell
   ./get-dependencies_mac.sh
   ```

The `get-dependencies_mac.sh` script will automatically:
   - Download + build [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
   - Build required dependencies
   
> vcpkg may require a newer compiler to build itself. Follow the instructions output by the `get-dependencies_mac.sh`.

### 3. Use _CMake_ to configure & generate the Xcode project

Again, from the root of the Git repo / source code:

1. Run the following command:
   ```shell
   cmake '-H.' -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G"Xcode"
   ```

This will run CMake to generate the Xcode project. The Xcode project (and other build files) will be generated in a `build` subdirectory.

> To change the build folder path, modify the `-Bbuild` portion of the command above. For example, `-B../wzbuild` will generate the build files in a `wzbuild` directory in the parent directory of the source code.


## Building:

The macOS port is built using the Xcode project generated by CMake. If following the instructions above, this will be located in a `build` subdirectory:
`$(SOURCE_DIR)/build/warzone2100.xcodeproj`

**To build the game from the command-line:**

1. Run the following command:
    ```shell
    xcodebuild -project build/warzone2100.xcodeproj -target warzone2100 -configuration Release -destination "platform=macOS"
    ```

You can also simply open the project in Xcode, and build the `warzone2100` scheme. (You may want to tweak it to build in a Release configuration - the default for that scheme in "Run" mode is Debug, for easier development.)


## Deployment:

The macOS port produces a 64-bit [self-contained application bundle](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/BundleTypes/BundleTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i-CH101-SW13) that requires **macOS 10.9+**\* to run.

> \* See _Setup & Configuration_ for how to set the minimum deployment target.


## Additional Information:

The macOS port supports [sandboxing](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html), but this requires [code-signing](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) to be configured in the Xcode project.
(By default, code-signing is disabled in the Xcode project.)
