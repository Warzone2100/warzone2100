---------- pie_export.py v1.0 ----------

- completely compatible with the data loaded from the import script.
	conversely, the import script is completely compatible with pie's exported in
	blender.
- now handles any number of layers
- number of teamcolors no longer assumed to be 8 -- supports any number of
	teamcolors.
- now exports in either compliant pie 5 (working spec) or pie 2 formats
- the entirety of the pie spec (versions 2 and 5) are supported during export
	(as well as import)
- all valid pie objects can be exported at once

---------- pie_common.py v1.0 ----------

- a lot of shared operations have been abstracted into here, including basic
	gui support.
- various gui components now utilize the scroll wheel for handling content
	longer than can be fit on screen, instead of the previous "page" method.

---------- pie_import.py v1.2 ----------

- uses a more portable ui chaining system that will appear in pie_export.py
- ui now prefers scrolling with the mousewheel over using a "page" system

---------- pie_import.py v1.1 ----------

- all contents of a pie will be sub-objects of a PIE object.
- pie 5 texture coords are now considered fully opengl compatible, and the
	import script supports this specification.
- fixed some wierd list semantics in the blender code. should've worked before,
	definitely does now: the texture material is correctly added to the mesh, and
	thus using blender's rendering operation looks correct now.
- added framework for general configurability. this conf screen is mostly
	empty, atm.
- config options can now be saved in their current state during import, and
	reverted to either the user-selected defaults or script defaults. options may
	also be configured in the "Scripts Config Editor" script.
- layering script can be automatically run by importer now.
- custom scaling factor can be selected during import. may be useful if the
	user is editing pies larger in pie slicer for extra precision (a double size
	model made in pie slicer should get imported with a scale factor of 0.5, for
	example)
- now conforms to the "Scripts Config Editor" recommendations, and follows user
	settings for verbosity.
- temporary and poorly done fix for per's texpage selection problem -- now
	looks 3 levels deep for ./texpages if need be.
- now supports an arbitrary number of team colors
- fixed a nasty and hard to notice bug that always occured during import where
	the model got mirrored along the x axis on import. afaict, *all* versions of
	the import script	always did this.
- fixed a teamcolor problem where teamcolors would never import correctly.

---------- pie_levels_to_layers.py v0.2 ----------
- user can now have levels re-layered at will be running a script on any number
	of objects simultaneously (used to be part of the import script).
- now applies strictly to selected objects, but will now assign PIE_* and
	CONNECTOR_* to as many layers as there are selected, descendent levels

---------- pie_common v0.1 ----------
- fixed bug where not all settings would get saved the first time. namely the
	ones that didn't appear in the option gui for the import script. note: the
	names under which options will be saved will likely get to change very soon.
- added gpl license block
