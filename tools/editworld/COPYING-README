Warzone 2100 Source & Data

1) These source and data files are provided as is with no guarantees. 

2) No assistance or support will be offered or given. 

3) Everything you will require to make a build of the game should be here. If it isn't, you'll have to improvise(*).

4) None of us here at Pivotal Games are in a position to be able to offer any help with making this work.

5) This source code is released under the terms of the GNU Public License. 
	Please be sure to read the entirety of this license but the summary is that you're free to do what you want 
	with the source subject to making the full source code freely available in the event of the distribution 
	of new binaries.

Finally, the primary motivation for this release is for entertainment and educational purposes. On the subject of the 
latter, don't be surprised to see some pretty gnarly old-school C code in here; the game was a classic but 
large areas of the code aren't pretty; OO design and C++ evangelists beware!  We haven't spent any time 
cleaning the code or making if pretty - what you see is what you're getting, warts n' all.

Thankyou to Jonathan Kemp of Eidos Europe for permitting the release.  Thanks also to Frank Lamboy for 
assistance with the release and for campaigning along with many many others over the years for the source to be made
available. The correspondence, online petitions and persistence made this possible. We were constantly amazed at the
community support for Warzone even after all this time; it's nice to be able to give something back, 
assuming you can get it to compile...;-)
