#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 05/04/99. ##
#############################

Now handles TEXANIM style polygons, so displays correct clan colour for objects
in the 3d view.

You can now set triangle direction flags in edge brushes, should speed up cliff drawing.

Added edge brush properties dialog. Allows you to set attributes to use for individual
brushes.

Added flood fill with edge brush, should speed up edging large areas, just select the edge brush
to use, click on the edge fill tool, click on the area in the map to fill and away you go.

#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 29/04/99. ##
#############################

Now saves tile transformation preferences.

Fixed problem where pasting with no textures was changing the tile transformation flags.

Fixed map dump.

Fixed area x,y flip so it now flips triangle direction as well.


#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 26/04/99. ##
#############################


When creating a new map, automaticly adds scroll limits for "Entire Map".

Sea level now defaults to 0.

Height scale now defaults to 2.

Changed "Zero Camera Angle" to "Look North", dose what it says.

When pasting objects, now pastes using the current player id rather than the source objects
player id.

Copy/Paste interface has changed, you can now mark an area of tiles in the 2d or 3d views,
x or y flip the area and or copy it into the clipboard for pasting elsewhere on the map. Also
added paste preferences dialog so you can specify which elements of the clipboard get applied
to the map when pasting.

Added tool buttons to enable/disable rendering for each player number, so you can filter out
certain players from the 2d and 3d views.

Now loads names.txt and displays in game names for all objects, can be disabled from options menu.

Can now change light direction in 3d view, "L" varies Yaw, "K" varies pitch.

Can now rotate tile both ways using "E" and "R" keys. X and Y flip remain on the "X" and "Y" keys.

Object buttons in selection window now colour coded.

Maximises application window on execution.

Window layout changed.

3d view size increased to 800x600.

Data set files changed, now called "whatever.eds" instead of "whatever.txt", new files
specify tile texture page to load, default edge brushes and tile types for the tile set.
Also says where to load names.txt for the in game object names.
This should speed up creating new maps.

Can now import and export tile id maps in the same way as you could import,export height maps,
each pixel in the tile id map specifies the texture id to use for that tile in the world.

.LND file format has changed slightly to specifiy the data set to load as the first thing
in the file, old projects will still load but you will be prompted for the data set ".EDB"
file to load.

Removed some redundant menu options.

Maximum map size now limited to 250x250, as this is the largest the game, specificly the gateway
system can safely handle.

works on any machine with DirectX 6 installed and one for hardware rendering which
works on machines with DirectX 6 installed and a 3D accelerated video card thats up
to the job ie 8MB of video memory and can do textured 3d in a window, cards I know
work are Permedia 2,Matrox G200,ATI Rage Pro and Riva TNT.

stat file used in the game. The editor uses this file to determine which IMD's to load for
features.

The data set file now contains entries to define the paths for IMD textures for each class of
object. See WarzoneData.txt and NecromancyData.txt in the samples directory.

Fixed problems with object positioning for Warzone.

while the editor was running and then returning to the editor caused a SURFACE LOST error.

#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 10/10/97. ##
#############################

Added command line option to disable map size checking. Right click on the EditWorld shortcut
to get the properties up and add -nosizecheck to the target. Currently Warzone only supports
maps that are 2 to the power n in size ie 64x64, 128x128 so the editor checks the size
to see if it's valid. This option was added so that you can dissable this check if in the
future Warzone allows any size maps.

If you've got a 3d card then you can add -hardware as a command line option to enable hardware
acceleration in the editor. ( Hope you've got bucket loads of video ram ! )

#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 09/10/97. ##
#############################

You can now place structures and they work in the game.

Now automaticly levels the landscape under flanged objects and structures.

The data set file now contains entries to define the paths for IMD's and Stats for each class of
object. See WarzoneData.txt and NecromancyData.txt in the samples directory.

For Warzone the data set file's STRUCTURE section now contains the file name of the structure
stat file used in the game. The editor uses this file to determine which IMD's to load for
structures.

Warzone export option now exports struct.bjo, droid.bjo and templ.bjo so that you can now load exported
games directly into Warzone. Note that the droid.bjo and templ.bjo files are empty so if you wan't the
game to work properly you still have to copy these from an existing saved game ie the Final directory
in Deliverance\Data.

Directory structure changed. The directory structure is now much more rational. An example tree
for Warzone would be:

Deliverance/Data/
        The Warzone data directory.

    MyScenario.lnd
        The project file saved by the editor.

    Textures.pcx
        Terrain textures , referenced by MyScenario.lnd.

    DataSet.txt
        File defining the data set, referenced by MyScenerio.lnd.

    Stats/
        Directory containing the stats

        Structures.txt
            Stats text file defining the structures used in the game.

    Structs/
        Directory containing all the IMD's and PCX's needed for the structures.

        xxxx


    Features/
        Directory containing all the IMD's and PCX's needed for the features.

        xxxx
    MyScenario.gam
        Save game file created when you export the scenario from the editor.

    MyScenario/
        Save game directory created when you export the scenario from the editor.

        Game.map
            Save game data...

        Struct.bjo

        Feat.bjo

        Droid.bjo

        Templ.bjo


An example tree for Necromancy would be:

Necromancy/Data/
    The Necromancy data directory.

    MyScenario.lnd
        The project file saved by the editor.

    Textures.pcx
        Terrain textures , referenced by MyScenario.lnd.

    DataSet.txt
        File defining the data set, referenced by MyScenerio.lnd.

    Objects/
        Directory containing all the IMD's and PCX's needed for the structures.

        xxxx
            Directory containing the stats

    MyScenario.map
        Game map file created when you export the scenario from the editor.

    MyScenario.nob
        Object map file created when you export the scenario from the editor.


Now checks for transparancy flags in IMD's and does colour keying accordingly.

Added option to lock camera to a Warzone'ish view in the options menu.

#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 07/10/97. ##
#############################

Added option to disable smooth shading of objects. This is specified in the object set definition
file (ie Warzone.txt) by adding one of the following flags to each IMD definition:

	NOSHADE		use default shading.
	FLATSHADE	perform flat shading of each polygon.
	SMOOTHSHADE	Perform smooth gouraud shading of each polygon.

	eg...
		mislick.imd OVERLAYED TILESNAP KEY0 NOSHADE
		mibould1.imd FLANGED TILESNAP NOKEY SMOOTHSHADE


You can now flip and rotate textures in the texture selection window before laying them down
in the world. To reset all rotations and flips in the texture selection window select 
"Reset Texture Flags" in the "Map" menu.

Now checks for and deals with the double sided polygon flag in IMD's

#############################
## CHANGES AS OF 03/10/97. ##
#############################

Now works under release build of DX5

Option added to export Warzone scenarios.

Option added to export Necromancy scenarios.

Save Project now only saves the project file (.LND) use the seperate Export functions to export
scenarios for Warzone or Necromancer.

When exporting Warzone scenarios now creates the following files.

	* MyScenario.GAM
	* MyScenario/Game.MAP
	* MyScenario/Feat.BJO

	These can be copied to the Deliverance/Data directory although for now you will have to
 	copy the droid.bjo , struct.bjo and templ.bjo files from an existing game directory to
        the MyScenario directory as the editor dos'nt export these files.

Fixed edge brush window.

Can orbit camera around a point roughly 1/3 distance to the horizon using the < > keys.

Undo/Redo on all texture operations.

Auto scroll when painting / dragging etc in 2d view.

Default height set to 50%

Much more robust.

Colour keying of object textures. You need to specify an extra flag in the object set text
file ( ie features1.txt ) for each IMD. NOKEY for no colour keying or KEYn where n is the palette
index of the transparent colour ie KEY0.

	eg...
		mislick.imd OVERLAYED TILESNAP KEY0
		mibould1.imd FLANGED TILESNAP NOKEY

Objects are now smooth shaded. ( I'll be adding a flag to the object set text file to disable this
for individual objects )

Arbitraty rotation of objects ( as long as they are not flanged )

Option added in map preferences to set tile texture size.

Fixed bug when loading multiple texture pages.

Option to export current height map as .PCX greyscale image.

Can now place , drag and rotate objects in 3d view as well as 2d view.

W and Q keys increase and decrease the 3d draw distance.

Option added to toggle smooth shading of landscape.
