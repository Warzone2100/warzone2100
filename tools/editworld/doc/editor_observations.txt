1. Is it possible to use two keys to rotate the map in the 3d view around the center of the view ?
2. Can an UNDO command be put in ?
3. When a tile is rotated  and then flipped , the 3d map view doesn't update until the camera moves off and comes back.
4. Pressing X in the top right hand corner of the window should prompt the user with a " Save Untitled.Ind ?" type message.
5. When painting a texture , the screen should scroll as the mose moves towards the edge of the window.
6. We need to be able to select an area and auto fill it with the selected texture.
7. Also, if rotate texture is selected, and the mouse is left clicked within a selected area ALL the tiles in that area should be rotated.
