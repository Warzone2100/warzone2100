_("Cyborg Factory")
_("A Cyborg Factory operates similarly to a standard Factory, but exclusively builds Cyborgs.")
_("Each Factory can build one unit at a time, but you can queue multiple units for production.")
_("When a unit is produced, it receives the Cyborg Factoryâ€™s Unit Orders and proceeds to the factory's Rally Point.")
