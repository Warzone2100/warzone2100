_("Cyborg Factory")
_("A Cyborg Factory operates similarly to a standard Factory, but exclusively builds Cyborgs.")
_("Each Factory can build one Cyborg at a time, but you can queue multiple Cyborgs for production.")
_("When a Cyborg is produced, it receives the Cyborg Factory’s Unit Orders and proceeds to the factory's Rally Point.")
