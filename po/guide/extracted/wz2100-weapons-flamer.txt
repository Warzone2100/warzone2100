_("Flamer")
_("Incendiary \"Flamer\" weapons are effective against infantry and weaker propulsion tanks.")
_("Flamer weapons are also excellent against bunkers and scavenger structures, but weaker against other structures.")
_("Flamers can \"penetrate\" units, damaging and possibly igniting multiple units in a single burst, thus making Flamer weapons excellent crowd-killers.")
_("However, due to their short attack ranges, Flamer weapons can be risky to use.")
