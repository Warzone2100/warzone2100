_("Artillery")
_("Artillery weapons are devastating against infantry and most structures.")
_("However, Artillery weapons are less effective against bunkers and tracked vehicles.")
_("Most (but not all) Artillery weapons must be stationary in order to fire. This combined with the very low amount of hitpoints provided by Artillery weapons means Artillery-equipped units are vulnerable on their own.")
_("Thus, Artillery weapons are best used to support other units or structures while avoiding direct confrontation.")
