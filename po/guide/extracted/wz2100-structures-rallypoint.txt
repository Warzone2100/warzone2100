_("Rally Point")
_("When a Factory has finished building a unit, the unit will spawn next to the Factory, and then proceed to the Factory's designated Rally Point.")
_("By default, the Rally Point is placed next to the Factory. Clicking a Rally Point will allow you to move it.")
_("Note: Moving a Rally Point while a unit is moving to it will not affect the unit's path.")
