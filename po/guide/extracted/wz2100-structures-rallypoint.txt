_("Rally Point")
_("When a factory has finished building a unit, the unit will spawn next to the factory, and then proceed to the designated rally point of the factory.")
_("By default, the rally point is placed next to the factory. Clicking a rally point will allow you to move it in a similar way to building a structure.")
_("Note: moving a rally point while a unit is moving to one will not affect its path.")
