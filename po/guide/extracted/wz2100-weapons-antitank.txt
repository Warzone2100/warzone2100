_("Anti-Tank")
_("Anti-Tank weapons are specialized against all types of enemy vehicles.")
_("However, Anti-Tank weapons are less effective against structures, and especially ineffective against infantry.")
_("Generally, Anti-Tank weapons are lightweight, but provide very little hitpoints. Vehicles with these weapons will be more frail than ones equipped with most other weapon types.")
