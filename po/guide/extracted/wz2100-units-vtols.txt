_("VTOLs")
_("VTOLs are used similarly to ground units. However, they do have a few differences.")
_("To produce VTOL units, you will need to have discovered & researched the \"VTOL Propulsion\" and \"VTOL Factory\".")
_("You should also research and build a few \"VTOL Rearming Pads\", so your VTOL units can reload ammo.")
