_("CB Sensors")
_("Counter-Battery (CB) Sensors dramatically alter the battlefield by allowing artillery units to directly target distant artillery platforms - provided they have the range.")
_("Identified structures or units will be colored red in the fog of war once a CB Sensor detects the launch of any enemy artillery.")
_("If active, artillery units prioritize CB Sensor targets over targets revealed by normal Sensors.")
