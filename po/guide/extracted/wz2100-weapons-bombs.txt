_("Bomb Bays")
_("Bomb bays are a unique weapon type that can only be equipped onto VTOLs.")
_("While their attack range is short and their ammo capacity is low, bomb bays grant bonus hitpoints and generally pack a more powerful payload compared to other VTOL weapons.")
_("Like all other weapons, different bombs have different effects, strengths, and applications.")
