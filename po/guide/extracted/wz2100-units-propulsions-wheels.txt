_("Wheels")
_("Wheels are the most basic vehicle propulsion.")
_("They are inexpensive and fast to produce, and also have a high maximum speed.")
_("However, they are vulnerable to most types of damage, and don't provide many hitpoints.")
_("Wheels are best used on vehicles that operate behind the front lines, or vehicles that exploit their high speed for hit-and-run attacks.")
