_("Cyborgs")
_("Cyborgs are your main infantry units.")
_("They are fast and reliable units, and are extremely resistant to Anti-Tank weapons.")
_("However, they are more vulnerable to Anti-Personnel and Artillery weapons.")
_("Note that Cyborgs cannot be designed. Cyborg templates are researched independently, and require a Cyborg Factory to produce.")
