_("VTOL Factory")
_("A VTOL Factory is used to build units with VTOL propulsion (i.e. flying units).")
_("Each VTOL Factory can build one unit at a time, but you can queue multiple units for production.")
_("When a VTOL Factory is done building a unit, it will order it to fly and land near the factory's Rally Point.")
