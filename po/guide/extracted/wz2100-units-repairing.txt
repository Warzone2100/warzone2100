_("Repairing Units")
_("You can design a unit with a repair turret instead of a weapon, and it can be ordered to repair your other units.")
_("You can also keep the repair units back from the battle, and use the Retreat Options to set your offensive units to retreat to them for repair at a certain damage level.")
_("Retreating and repairing units is often far preferable to losing experienced units on the battlefield.")
