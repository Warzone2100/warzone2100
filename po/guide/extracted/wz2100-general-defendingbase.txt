_("As such, preparing for the future defense of your home base is essential.")
_("While units are obviously helpful to defend your base, the design of your base is also critical.")
_("Build defensive structures that provide cover, restrict access, sense enemies, and dispense damage, so that you can better counter enemy attacks.")
