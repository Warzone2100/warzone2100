_("Tracks")
_("Tracks are a highly-armored propulsion for vehicles.")
_("They provide a large amount of hitpoints, as well as high resistances against Anti-Personnel and Artillery damage.")
_("However, they come at a higher production cost, have longer build times, and are still very vulnerable to Anti-Tank weapons.")
_("Additionally, Tracks come with a hefty penalty to their maximum speed.")
_("Due to their high durability, Tracks are perfect for vehicles designed for combat on the front lines.")
_("Care must be taken, however. Their slow movement speed can make escaping unfavorable situations very difficult.")
