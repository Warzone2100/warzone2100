_("Weapons")
_("Most weapons have a VTOL equivalent, which does at least twice as much damage, but has limited ammo.")
_("VTOL versions of regular weapons do not need to be researched separately.")
_("In addition to VTOL versions of ground-based direct weapons, VTOLs can also use bomb weapons. These weapons are the equivalent of artillery, and are very powerful.")
