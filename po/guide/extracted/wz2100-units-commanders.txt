_("Commanders")
_("Command turrets are used much like sensors, except they can command any attacking unit, not just artillery.")
_("Commanders provide an accuracy, armor, and movement speed bonus to all units assigned to them, which increases as the commander's rank increases.")
_("They are limited to having 6 attacking units assigned to them at first, but this limit rises by 2 each time the commander gains a rank.")
