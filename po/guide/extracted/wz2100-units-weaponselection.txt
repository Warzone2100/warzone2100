_("Weapon Selection")
_("As you discover and research more weapons, you'll also discover that certain weapons may work dramatically better for certain situations than others (or versus certain enemy units or structures).")
_("When you complete research on a new weapon, an intelligence screen message will provide some information on its attributes.")
_("It is to your advantage to experiment with different weapon types. If you're having trouble and haven't re-evaluated your force's composition in a while, it might be time to consider changing the weapons for stronger ones, or new varieties!")
