_("Defending Against VTOLs")
_("What's that in the sky? ... It's a VTOL unit")
_("Since VTOLs are not ground-based units, most ground weapons cannot hit them.")
_("They can only be hit by either anti-air (often abbreviated \"AA\") or versatile (can hit air or ground) weapons.")
_("There are only a few weapons that are versatile: machineguns, lasers, and Mini-Rocket Pod.")
_("(Rockets and missiles are also versatile, but only when mounted on a cyborg or VTOL.)")
_("In addition to being uncommon, versatile weapons do not do as much damage to VTOLs as dedicated anti-air, so having some AA is recommended against VTOLs.")
