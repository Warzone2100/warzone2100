_("Sensors")
_("Sensors can be used for scouting and surveillance, but they also have a more important usage: to spot for artillery.")
_("Artillery weapons, by themselves, cannot fire more than their own sensor range (8 tiles without upgrades).")
_("However, even the most basic artillery weapon has a weapon range that exceeds its built-in sensor range. To use it, you will need to build and deploy sensors on the battlefield (either sensor towers or tanks with sensor turrets).")
