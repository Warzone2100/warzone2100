_("Using Sensors")
_("Artillery structures are the easiest. Simply build a sensor tower, and if the sensor tower is targeting something within your artillery structures' weapon range, they will fire at it.")
_("An artillery tank, however, needs to be explicitly assigned to a sensor to function. Select the artillery tanks, then click on a sensor to assign the tanks to the sensor.")
_("Once the artillery is assigned, if it is assigned to a sensor tower, that tower will target enemies that come in range automatically.")
_("If it is assigned to a sensor tank, the sensor can be used to attack enemies by selecting the sensor and targeting an enemy. All artillery assigned to the sensor will attack its target.")
