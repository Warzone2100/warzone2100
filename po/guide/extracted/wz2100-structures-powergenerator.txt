_("Power Generator")
_("Power is generated by Power Generators that are fed by Oil Derricks.")
_("Each Power Generator uses up to 4 Oil Derricks. So, for example, if you have 10 Oil Derricks you would need 3 Power Generators to utilize all of the oil derricks and generate maximum Power.")
_("While oil derricks must be built on oil resources, Power Generators can be built anywhere on the map. But keep in mind: additional generators beyond one for every 4 derricks will provide no benefit.")
