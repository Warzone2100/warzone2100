_("Half-tracks")
_("Half-tracks are a hybrid propulsion between Wheels and Tracks.")
_("They have a moderate cost and speed, and provide a moderate amount of hitpoints.")
_("They also provide resistance against Anti-Personnel and Artillery damage, but are still quite vulnerable to Anti-Tank weapons.")
_("Half-tracks are excellent for general-purpose units, but don't quite provide the high durability of Tracks or the high speeds of Wheels.")
