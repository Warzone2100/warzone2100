_("High-Explosive Bombs")
_("Explosive bombs act similarly to ground-based Artillery weapons (such as Mortars).")
_("These bombs explode on impact, damaging everything caught in the blast.")
_("Like Artillery weapons, explosive bombs excel at destroying most structures and groups of infantry and light vehicles, but struggle against bunkers and heavily armored tanks.")
_("Just make sure your own units and structures aren't caught in the blast!")
