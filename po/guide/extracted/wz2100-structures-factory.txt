_("Factory")
_("A Factory is used to build units. Each Factory can build one unit at a time, but you can queue multiple units for production.")
_("When a unit is produced, it receives the Factoryâ€™s Unit Orders and proceeds to the Factory's Rally Point.")
_("Note: The base Factory is only able to produce units with Light bodies. Factory modules must be discovered and built to upgrade Factory production capabilities.")
