;Section headers in brackets [...] is system ID of structures. This IDs should be unique.
;Following properties can be used in structures: 
  ;buildPoints = <integer> defines how much truck-power you need to build-up structure
  ;buildPower = <integer> defines oil price of structure
  ;bodyPoints = <integer>
  ;armour = <integer> kinecic and heat armor of structure
  ;strength = <string> Armor type of the structure; SOFT; MEDIUM; HARD; BUNKER. Controls which weapon types it's effective against.
  ;height = <integer> The height of the structure. Affects whether or not it can fire over walls.
  ;baseWidth = <integer> Number of Y tiles used by this structure.
  ;baseBreadth = <integer> Number of X tiles used by this structure.
  ;structureModel = <comma-separated string list> The pie models names used by this structure.
  ;baseModel = <string> The base pie/texture below the structure.
  ;type = <string> Type of the structure: DEFEND; FACTORY; POWER GENERATOR; WALL; CORNER; DOOR etc.
  ;sensorID = <string> ID of sensor component. Affects visibility range; can be sensor turret.
  ;resistance = <integer> Resistance points to NEXUS convert/capture weapons.
  ;weapons = <comma-separated string list> list of weapons attached to structure
  ;ecmID = <string> ID of ECM turret (used for ECM tower)
