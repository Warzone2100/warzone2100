<P><FONT color=#cc0000></FONT></P><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000 size=4>Changes of NTW Mod Version 1.6.6:</FONT></STRONG></P></EM>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Why NTW?&nbsp; N = New, T = Team & W = War. In the old Warzone days was 1 Map very popular, Team War (TW). Today we play New Team War (NTW). This Map is inside the NTW Mod + my Map NTW ver2. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- A great new look with Day/Night and Weather. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Tiger class &  Dragon are faster but a bit slower than Python (class). Wyvern is a bit faster than Python. VTOL Weapons are not so strong (bombs are a bit better) and Cyborg Weapons are stronger (strong like the Tanks). Combat Engineer & Cyborg Mechanic do there job better too now. (like in T1 Balancer) -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Mini Rocket Artillery got the same range like Mortar. Tank Killer got a faster reload & a range like Rail Gun (like in T1 Balancer) -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Ripple Rockets shoot 8x, Archangle Missile shoot 6x. The reload times of them are longer and they got better Names. Artillery Sites looks like a Site now. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced Angel Missile in Condor Missile. It got Hellstorms range with much Damage and reload Time is 15-40 sec. The costs are  high and it is a Artillery. Its on Archangle Missles place and it comes after Condor Missile. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced Laser Sat in a stronger Mini Nuclear Missile Silo. And there is a Nuclear Reactor with Cooling Towers which give you more Power. But only if you connect a Nuclear Reactor with 2 Cooling Towers. You need Vapor Turbine Generator Mk3 for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- VTOL Truck, VTOL Sensor, VTOL CB Sensor, Bunker Buster Tower and Cyborg Transporter with Heavy&nbsp;Pulse Laser (good&nbsp; vs&nbsp;Buildings) available -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- You need for Command Relay Post: Sensor Tower & Command Center. The other things are here:<A href="./NTW Mod Tree.jpg"> NTW Mod Research Tree</A> (almost all from T1 Balancer). -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Mobile Wide Spectrum Sensor is off and i didnt changed the info Text for the new Weapons... sorry. But there is a new Plasma Sniper Cyborg : ). You need Super Pulse Laser Cyborg for him. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Heavy Pulse Laser and Plasma Cannon are useful now (longer range, more damage, good vs Buildings). (like in T1 Balancer) -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced AA Laser in Tank Killer Laser (Tank Killer Laser Defends got the same range like Scourge Missile Defends good vs Tanks and bad vs Buildings). It is better than Railgun and almost good like Gauss. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced Flash Light Laser in Light Pulse Laser (short range) and Pulse Laser in Twin Pulse Laser (long range, good vs Buildings and bad vs Tanks). -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced HPV Cannon in Twin Heavy Cannon (good vs Tanks). Heavy Cannon is not better and not worse but cheaper. Well, its not much useful and not like this one in 1.11 or 1.12 Patch! You need Heavy Cannon, HVAPFSDS Cannon Rounds Mk3, Cannon Autoloader Mk1 and Panther Body for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced Incenediary Mortar in Super Twin Cannon (a good anti Tank Weapon again). Its a bit better than Rail Gun but cost more. You need Twin Heavy Cannon, Mantis Body and Cannon Rapid Loader Mk1 for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Another new Weapon is the Heavy Gauss Cannon. Its Heavyer than Gauss, got a slower reload, cost more and you need more time to produce it. But it do more Damage and got more Durability. Research Gauss Cannon for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Nexus Link shoot during moving and you can build his Tower faster with lower costs (only Nexus Tower). Plasma Cannon Emplacement got the right Research Menu Icon now and Scorpion Body (VTOL and Wheels Bug) is repaired. (like in T1 Balancer) -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Flamers shoot during moving, got a bit longer range, are weaker with slower reload time and cost a bit more.&nbsp;good vs: soft Buildings, Bunker, Wheels, Hovers and bad vs: hard Buildings, half Tracks and Tracks (like in T1 Balancer) -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- some Scavenger Buildings, -Units, Mines, Mines Sign and Cyborg Mine Sweeper are available. Btw. Lancer & Scourge reload speed Upgrade dont work in 1.10 but in 2.x. And to keep the old Balance a bit, is the Upgrade for Lancer out and for Scourge used to Upgrade Condor Missile (it Upgrade Scourge too but much later). -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Assault Cannon (from 7500 to 1000) (You need just Medium Cannon for it), Twin Assault Cannon (from 8500 to 3000), Heavy Pulse Laser (from 20000 to 4000), Plasma Cannon (from 30000 to 6000), EMP Cannon (from 10000 to 5000), Heavy Cannon (from 10000 to 8000) and Medium Cannon (from 5000 to 4000) are not so heavy. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- All Emplacements are Bunkers (costs rebalanced) and you can build all Fortresses faster with lower costs. Lancer Bunker cost 25 more now. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- good luck and have fun meight ^_^  -</FONT></P><BR>
