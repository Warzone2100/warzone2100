For gathering almost all licensor addresses and other help:
   DevUrandom - devurandom@gna.org

For a bit more "instant" tech/game talk,
there is also an IRC-Channel called #warzone2100 on freenode.
Due the fact that the most "official" guys live in europe,
you may meet us there around late afternoon (CET) with a little luck.
But there are also some other nice guys which can may help you.
