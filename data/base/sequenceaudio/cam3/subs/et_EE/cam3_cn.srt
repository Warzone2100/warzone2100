00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Commander, you're proving to be more resilient than I thought.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Nii kahju, et sa loobusid varem minuga liitumast.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But no matter, as you'll not be here much longer.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
After much searching and reprogramming, I've finally got all my systems back on-line.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Once I destroyed the world with nuclear fire to clear the way for my cybernetic future.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I now intend to further shape the world into my own image, by  surgically removing unwanted growths like yourself.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My Laser Satellites are now powering up. I intend to test them on you first, Commander!
