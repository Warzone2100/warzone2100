		"Unlike ground units, which reload automatically, VTOLs carry a limited amount of ammo. Once that ammo runs out, the VTOL canâ€™t attack until it refuels.",
		"",
		"A VTOL out of ammo will automatically find a VTOL rearming pad to rearm and repair itself (and will resume attacking once fully rearmed), or it can be manually rearmed by selecting it and clicking on a rearming pad.",
		"",
		"Unlike other units which usually attack the nearest target, VTOLs will not attack anything automatically. However, by selecting a VTOL and alt+clicking on an area, a VTOL will patrol the area between its current location and the clicked location, and attack anything in the vicinity.",
		"",
		"Alternatively, VTOLs can be assigned to VTOL Strike Towers and VTOL CB Towers, which will cause them to function similarly to artillery assigned to sensor towers."
