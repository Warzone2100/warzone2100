00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The NASDA system was developed to protect us. It was to be the ultimate nuclear deterrent. As it turned out, it was our executioner.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Reports said that NASDA developed a fault during a routine systems check. Don't believe it. Someone wanted it to take us out.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Those nukes were targeted on every major city around the world. NASDA was programmed to start the Collapse. When the counterstrikes launched, its laser defenses and anti-missile ground sites failed.

4
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,000
The world as we knew it ended...

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The Nuclear Winter hit hard. Disease and famine claimed most of us who had survived the nuclear strikes. Wars over cans of dog food took even more.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We'd fled Seattle early in '86. We'd heard that the Rocky Mountains were relatively rad-free.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
After fighting off bands of marauders we came across the base. Its personnel were dead. Killed by any one of a number of virulent diseases.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We cracked the doors, and cleared out the bodies inside.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:42,400
We knew that things would never be the same again, but we were determined to build a new world out of the ruins. We rebuilt the landing pads and brought the old systems back on-line.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We were finally ready to begin the Project.
