NASDA (PASKA) on Põhja Ameerika Strateegilise Kaitse Agentuur

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:36,250
NASDA loodi 2076. aastal, et kaitsta Põhja Ameerikat tava- ja tuumarünnakute eest. Satelliit kaitse süsteemide ehitamine algas 2081. ja lõppes 2082. aastal.

2085.aastal tulistasis NASDA satelliidid oma tuumapommidega Maad.

00:00:52,916 --> 00:01:06,666
There were also ground-based sites. Many of these were destroyed in the nuclear counterstrikes, but there's bound to be some out there.

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:23,333
The NASDA satellites also contained pulse-lasers designed to shoot down missiles approaching North America.

00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:46,250
During the counterstrikes, these LasSats failed to fire. If brought into operation, these LasSats could inflict major damage on ground targets.

Kõik tuumapommid, mis sihiti Põhja Ameerikasse tabasid märki.

00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:21,666
We know that Nexus is searching for NASDA Central in the Eastern Sector. This was one of the land-based control centres for the satellites.

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,083
If the centre is found intact, NEXUS may gain control of the satellites.

00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:34,166
Nexus claimed that it had already destroyed the world.
