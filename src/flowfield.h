// map_coord(x, y) -> tile
// world_coord(tile) -> x, y
// getTileMaxMin <- maybe?
// fpathBlockingTile(x, y, PROPULSION_TYPE_WHEELED) - is field blocking for given propulsion
// mapTile(x, y) -> MAPTILE
// worldTile(x, y) -> MAPTILE
// TileIsOccupied <- maybe, to check if there is a building on that tile
// TileIsKnownOccupied <- like above
// tileIsExplored

// MAPTILE.limitedContinent - if I understand it correctly, if there is no ground path between two tiles, then limitedContinent1 != limitedContinent2
// MAPTILE.hoverContinent - like above, but what is continent for hover?
// extern SDWORD	mapWidth, mapHeight;

// TODO: maybe prefer visible tiles, or just discovered tiles (for player)
