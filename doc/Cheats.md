# Warzone 2100 Cheats

Like many other games, Warzone 2100 features a certain set of cheats that can be
used to have an advantage in the singleplayer-campaign and skirmish-games, or to
just help mod-makers and map-makers with testing. Cheats do not work in multiplayer,
unless all players agree to it.

Cheats are likely to contain or trigger bugs, so use with care, especially
during campaign.

### Entering Cheat Mode

To enable cheats while in-game, press `Shift` and `Backspace` simultaneously.
An on-screen message should appear telling you that cheat mode has been enabled.
You can disable it using the same key combination again.

Pressing `CTRL`+`O` opens up the debug menu, which is useful for inspecting the
game state, or just messing around.

### Cheat Commands

After activating cheat mode, cheats can be entered using the normal chat-
function. Cheats are ordered by their use and where they can be used.

There are many cheat commands. Some examples:

* `biffer baker` - Your units do more damage and are stronger
