# Functions

This section describes functions that can be called from scripts to make
things happen in the game (usually called our script 'API').

## profile(function[, arguments])
Calls a function with given arguments, measures time it took to evaluate the function,
and adds this time to performance monitor statistics. Transparently returns the
function's return value. The function to run is the first parameter, and it
_must be quoted_. (3.2+ only)

## include(file)
Includes another source code file at this point. You should generally only specify the filename,
not try to specify its path, here.
However, *if* you specify sub-paths / sub-folders, the path separator should **always** be forward-slash ("/").

## includeJSON(file)
Reads a JSON file and returns an object. You should generally only specify the filename,
However, *if* you specify sub-paths / sub-folders, the path separator should **always** be forward-slash ("/").

## setTimer(function, milliseconds[, object])

Set a function to run repeated at some given time interval. The function to run
is the first parameter, and it _must be quoted_, otherwise the function will
be inlined. The second parameter is the interval, in milliseconds. A third, optional
parameter can be a **game object** to pass to the timer function. If the **game object**
dies, the timer stops running. The minimum number of milliseconds is 100, but such
fast timers are strongly discouraged as they may deteriorate the game performance.

```javascript
  function conDroids()
  {
     ... do stuff ...
  }
  // call conDroids every 4 seconds
  setTimer("conDroids", 4000);
```

## removeTimer(function)

Removes an existing timer. The first parameter is the function timer to remove,
and its name _must be quoted_.

## queue(function[, milliseconds[, object]])

Queues up a function to run at a later game frame. This is useful to prevent
stuttering during the game, which can happen if too much script processing is
done at once.  The function to run is the first parameter, and it
_must be quoted_, otherwise the function will be inlined.
The second parameter is the delay in milliseconds, if it is omitted or 0,
the function will be run at a later frame.  A third optional
parameter can be a **game object** to pass to the queued function. If the **game object**
dies before the queued call runs, nothing happens.

## namespace(prefix)
Registers a new event namespace. All events can now have this prefix. This is useful for
code libraries, to implement event that do not conflict with events in main code. This
function should be called from global; do not (for hopefully obvious reasons) put it
inside an event.

## debugGetCallerFuncName()
Returns the function name of the caller of the current context as a string (if available).
ex.
```javascript
  function FuncA() {
    var callerFuncName = debugGetCallerFuncName();
    debug(callerFuncName);
  }
  function FuncB() {
    FuncA();
  }
  FuncB();
```
Will output: "FuncB"
Useful for debug logging.

## enumTemplates(player)

Return an array containing all the buildable templates for the given player. (3.2+ only)

## removeReticuleButton(button type)

Remove reticule button. DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING.

## removeBeacon(target player)

Remove a beacon message sent to target player. Target may also be ```ALLIES```.
Returns a boolean that is true on success. (3.2+ only)

## resetLabel(label[, filter])

Reset the trigger on an label. Next time a unit enters the area, it will trigger
an area event. Next time an object or a group is seen, it will trigger a seen event.
Optionally add a filter on it in the second parameter, which can
be a specific player to watch for, or ALL_PLAYERS by default.
This is a fast operation of O(log n) algorithmic complexity. (3.2+ only)
## resetArea(label[, filter])
Reset the trigger on an area. Next time a unit enters the area, it will trigger
an area event. Optionally add a filter on it in the second parameter, which can
be a specific player to watch for, or ALL_PLAYERS by default.
This is a fast operation of O(log n) algorithmic complexity. DEPRECATED - use resetLabel instead. (3.2+ only)

## enumLabels([filter])

Returns a string list of labels that exist for this map. The optional filter
parameter can be used to only return labels of one specific type. (3.2+ only)

## addLabel(object, label[, triggered])

Add a label to a game object. If there already is a label by that name, it is overwritten.
This is a fast operation of O(log n) algorithmic complexity. (3.2+ only)
Can optionally specify an initial "triggered" value for the label. (3.4+ only)

## removeLabel(label)

Remove a label from the game. Returns the number of labels removed, which should normally be
either 1 (label found) or 0 (label not found). (3.2+ only)

## getLabel(object)

Get a label string belonging to a game object. If the object has multiple labels, only the first
label found will be returned. If the object has no labels, undefined is returned.
This is a relatively slow operation of O(n) algorithmic complexity. (3.2+ only)

## getObject(label | x, y | type, player, id)

Fetch something denoted by a label, a map position or its object ID. A label refers to an area,
a position or a **game object** on the map defined using the map editor and stored
together with the map. In this case, the only argument is a text label. The function
returns an object that has a type variable defining what it is (in case this is
unclear). This type will be one of DROID, STRUCTURE, FEATURE, AREA, GROUP or POSITION.
The AREA has defined 'x', 'y', 'x2', and 'y2', while POSITION has only defined 'x' and 'y'.
The GROUP type has defined 'type' and 'id' of the group, which can be passed to enumGroup().
This is a fast operation of O(log n) algorithmic complexity. If the label is not found, an
undefined value is returned. If whatever object the label should point at no longer exists,
a null value is returned.

You can also fetch a STRUCTURE or FEATURE type game object from a given map position (if any).
This is a very fast operation of O(1) algorithmic complexity. Droids cannot be fetched in this
manner, since they do not have a unique placement on map tiles. Finally, you can fetch an object using
its ID, in which case you need to pass its type, owner and unique object ID. This is an
operation of O(n) algorithmic complexity. (3.2+ only)

## enumArea(<x1, y1, x2, y2 | label>[, filter[, seen]])

Returns an array of game objects seen within the given area that passes the optional filter
which can be one of a player index, ALL_PLAYERS, ALLIES or ENEMIES. By default, filter is
ALL_PLAYERS. Finally an optional parameter can specify whether only visible objects should be
returned; by default only visible objects are returned. The label can either be actual
positions or a label to an AREA. Calling this function is much faster than iterating over all
game objects using other enum functions. (3.2+ only)

## enumGroup(group)

Return an array containing all the members of a given group.

## newGroup()

Allocate a new group. Returns its numerical ID. Deprecated since 3.2 - you should now
use your own number scheme for groups.

## groupAddArea(group, x1, y1, x2, y2)

Add any droids inside the given area to the given group. (3.2+ only)

## groupAddDroid(group, droid)

Add given droid to given group. Deprecated since 3.2 - use groupAdd() instead.

Add given game object to the given group.

## groupSize(group)

Return the number of droids currently in the given group. Note that you can use groupSizes[] instead.

## _(string)

Mark string for translation.

## syncRandom(limit)

Generate a synchronized random number in range 0...(limit - 1) that will be the same if this function is
run on all network peers in the same game frame. If it is called on just one peer (such as would be
the case for AIs, for instance), then game sync will break. (3.2+ only)

is zero for vision reveal, or one for radar reveal. The difference is that a radar reveal can be obstructed
by ECM jammers. ```expiry```, if non-zero, is the game time at which the spotter shall automatically be
removed. The function returns a unique ID that can be used to remove the spotter with ```removeSpotter```. (3.2+ only)

## removeSpotter(id)

Remove a spotter given its unique ID. (3.2+ only)

## syncRequest(req_id, x, y[, obj[, obj2]])
