Interface
---------

The interface can be turned on or off with Tab.

image:images/interface.jpg[]

- 'Messages (top)': The message bank. This keeps all the last few messages
given to you by the game. To see more of your most recent messages, press the
`/~ key (this is the backtick/tilde key; usually found between Esc and Tab).
- 'Time remaining (top right)': The time limit. This is only seen during
Campaign. If this goes down to zero, you lose!
- 'Command panel (bottom left)': The <<_command_panel, command panel>>.
- 'Power (bottom)': The <<_power, power bar>>.
- 'Map (bottom right)': The <<_minimap, minimap>>.


Controlling the Camera
----------------------

.What is the Camera?
When Warzone was released in 1999, it was one of the first real-time strategy
games to be in 3D. Now, most real-time strategies are in 3D, but, if you're not
used to the new trend, let us help you along.


.Basic Controls
- 'Moving': To move where you're looking at, move the mouse to the edge of the
window/screen, or use the arrow keys.
- 'Rotating': To rotate the view, hold down the right mouse button, and move
the mouse in any direction. (The view can also be rotated using 8 and 2
(up/down), or 4 and 6 (left/right) on the numeric keypad.)
- 'Zooming': To zoom in or out, use the + or - keys on the numeric keypad, or
use the mouse wheel.

.Advanced Controls
- 'Reset view to north': If your camera angle feels unnatural, pressing
Backspace will reset your view to the north.
- 'Unit Tracking': Press Spacebar when units are selected, and the camera will
follow them. Press Spacebar again to stop Unit Tracking.
- 'Jump to base': Press B to center the view at your Command Center. Useful if
you need to get back to base quickly.


Minimap
-------

The minimap is a very useful tool on the Warzone battlefield. It helps you keep
track of your units and structures, your opponents units and structures (within
range), and the map itself. Orders can be issued over the minimap, and it can
be used to jump to part of the map very quickly.

The minimap is given after you build a Command Center.

image:images/minimap.jpg[]

- 'Faint-white trapezoid': This is a visual representation of your camera on
the radar. The large end points towards where you're looking. The small end is
where the camera is.
- 'Transparent areas': Unexplored - will peel away as you send units into them.
These areas are black on the screen.
- 'Green area': Units or structures that belong to the green player (in this
case, us).
- 'Yellow/gray/black/red/blue/cyan/magenta area': Units or structures that
belong to the yellow/gray/black/red/blue/cyan/magenta player (not pictured).
- 'Red/white flashing area': Units or structures belonging to you that are
under attack.
- 'Green pulse': Artifact. Needed to research technologies in Campaign. In
Skirmish/Multiplayer, can be found by destroying enemy base structures.
- 'Red pulse': An enemy base or other point of interest. Only used in Campaign.
- 'Blue pulse': A free <<_power, oil resource>>.


.Controls
- 'Moving the camera': Right-click anywhere on the minimap to move the camera.
- 'Giving orders': If you have units selected, click anywhere on the radar, and
the units will carry out that order.
- 'Zooming in and out': Hover your mouse over the minimap and move the mouse
wheel up or down.


Power
-----

image:images/powerbar.jpg[]

'The power bar'

image:images/oilresource.jpg[]

'A spare oil resource, and a derrick hard at work'

In real life, money is power, but in Warzone, power is money. You spend power
to build structures, manufacture units, and research upgrades/new technology.

Getting Power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So how do you get power? Power is generated by Oil Derricks. However, you must
have at least one Power Generator for every four Oil Derricks.

Oil derricks must be built on oil resources, but the generator can be anywhere
on the map. Keep in mind that additional generators beyond one for every four
derricks will provide no benefit. Also note that building heaps of power
generators won't do anything at all until you have at least one oil derrick for
each.

Pricing
~~~~~~~

Icons in the Manufacture, Build, and Research menus will have yellow bars in
them representing their price:

image:images/cheapweapon.png[] 'Inexpensive weapon'

image:images/expensiveweapon.png[] 'Expensive weapon'

When you place your mouse over an icon, the power bar will have a green
section, representing its price. If you cannot afford it, the power bar will
instead turn red.

The amount of power you have is shown on the very left of the power bar. If you
place your mouse over an icon, if you have enough power to get it, the number
will show the amount of power it will cost. If you can't afford it, the number
will show the amount of power you need to be able to afford it.

Power is drawn as soon as the icon is clicked. Providing you have sufficient
power for the activity, the initial progress bar fills quickly with green
(slower with more costly actions) and the construction or research begins. A
yellow progress bar then charts the progress achieved by the current activity.

Upgrades
~~~~~~~~

image:images/powerupgrade.png[]

Power Generators can have a Power Module built on top of them to squeeze out
more power. Power Modules need to be researched before you can build them.
There are also several researchable upgrades available which increase the
amount of power you receive.


Ordering Units
--------------

Using Units
~~~~~~~~~~~

Gotten used to the interface? Okay, well, time to actually use our units.

Selecting and moving units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To select a unit or cyborg, left click on it. Multiple units can be selected by
clicking and dragging, and encasing the units in the drawn 'square', or by
holding down Ctrl or Shift and clicking on multiple units.

To move selected units, left click on the terrain of the map. This can also be
done over black areas of the map to explore the area. To attack an enemy unit,
left click on it. You can deselect a unit (or a group of units) with a
right-click.

Queuing and waypoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set a path with waypoints, which units will visit each waypoint in
order. You can also select a queue of enemies for units to attack. Hold Shift
or Ctrl while selecting units or clicking places to move.

This also works for queuing construction of Oil Derricks and/or structures in a
chain - hold the key down while building the structures one by one, then, when
building the final structure, release the key.

Groups of Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make groups of units, select the units you want and press Ctrl+['number'] to
make a group. A group of units will have a number next to it. To select a group
of units you have made, press ['number']. Groups can also be selected by
double-clicking a unit in a group. To center the camera on a group, press the
['number'] twice.

Defending
^^^^^^^^^

Click a friendly structure or truck with weapon units selected (the cursor will
be a shield) and the units will move to guard it.

Unit orders menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/unitordersmenu.jpg[]

Right-click on a unit (or select a unit and hit NUM0 on the numeric keypad),
and a unit orders menu will appear above the command panel. This contains
options to configure a unit's behaviour.

Right-clicking on a factory will customize the orders of all future units that
that factory produces.

Attack range
^^^^^^^^^^^^
|====
|image:images/attackrange.jpg[] |'Optimum Range': Fires at most accurate range
(default)

'Short Range': Moves to short range and attacks

'Long Range': Attacks at long range
|====

Retreat threshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
|====
|image:images/retreatthreshold.jpg[] |'Do or Die': Your unit will not retreat
unless ordered to. (default)

'Retreat at Medium Damage': Your unit will retreat (return to repair facility,
HQ, or LZ) at medium (yellow) damage

'Retreat at Heavy Damage': Your unit will retreat at heavy (red) damage
|====

Firing
^^^^^^
|====
|image:images/firing.jpg[] |'Fire At Will': Fires at any enemy (default)

'Return Fire': Only fire if fired at

'Do Not Fire': Units will not fire
|====

Movement
^^^^^^^^
|====
|image:images/movement.jpg[] |'Patrol': Moves in a circle on a position. Just
click an area after selecting it.

'Pursue': Pursue enemy.

'Guard': Stay near an area or structure. (default)

'Hold Position': Do not move under any circumstances.
|====

Return
^^^^^^
|====
|image:images/return.jpg[] |'Return for Repair': Unit will return to a Repair
Facility

'Return to HQ': Unit will return to Command Center or LZ (campaign)

'Go To Transport': Unit will go and board transport
|====

Recycling
^^^^^^^^^

image:images/recycling.jpg[]

Recycling a unit will send it to the nearest Repair Facility or Factory, and
destroy it. Half the power used in making it will be refunded to you. The
unit's experience level will be placed in the next unit that is manufactured.

Unit experience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See also: image:images/www.png[URL] http://guide.wz2100.net/experience[Unit
experience]

Units have experience levels depending on how many kills the unit has. A higher
experience level means that a unit is more accurate, moves faster and takes
less damage. An icon displaying a unit's rank is displayed next to the unit's
health bar.

Hardpoints and bunkers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hardpoints, bunkers, and other defensive structures cannot be ordered to shoot
directly. However, you can assign artillery emplacements to a sensor tower.
Nearby commanders with the 'indirect fire support' option activated will also
command these structures.

Indirect-fire units and sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See: <<_artillery_and_sensors, Sensors and artillery>>


Ordering VTOLs
--------------

VTOLs are used similarly to ground units. However, they do have a few
differences. For one thing, they can 'fly'...

Design and production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To produce VTOL units, you'll need the image:images/www.png[URL]
http://guide.wz2100.net/r/vtolpropulsion[VTOL Propulsion] and
image:images/www.png[URL] http://guide.wz2100.net/r/vtolfactory[VTOL Factory]
researched, and a VTOL Factory built. You should also research and build a few
image:images/www.png[URL] http://guide.wz2100.net/r/vtolrearmingpad[VTOL
Rearming Pads], otherwise, they won't be able to reload ammo.

Before you produce a VTOL unit, you must design it. VTOLs are designed the same
way as regular units -- simply select 'VTOL propulsion' -- but use slightly
different weapons (more on that later).

VTOLs can only be built at VTOL Factories. VTOL factories can be upgraded with
factory modules -- there's no need to research a separate "VTOL factory
module".

Moving
~~~~~~

After producing a VTOL from a VTOL Factory, it will fly and land on the rally
point. VTOLs can be ordered to move and attack like any regular unit. Although
they will fly over water and cliffs, they can't land on them.

Attacking
~~~~~~~~~

VTOL weapons differ drastically from the norm.

To attack with a VTOL, select it and click an enemy like normal. However, you
may have noticed the white ammo bar below its health bar as you start
attacking.

Unlike ground units, which reload automatically, VTOLs carry a limited amount
of ammo. Once that ammo runs out, the VTOL can't attack until it refuels. A
VTOL out of ammo will automatically find a VTOL rearming pad to rearm and
repair itself (and will resume attacking once fully rearmed), or it can be
manually rearmed by selecting it and clicking on a rearming pad.

VTOLs will not attack anything automatically. However, by selecting a VTOL and
alt+clicking on an area, a VTOL will patrol the area between its current
location and the clicked location, and attack anything in the vicinity.
Alternatively, they can be assigned to VTOL strike towers and VTOL CB towers,
which will cause them to function similarly to <<_artillery_and_sensors,
artillery assigned to sensor towers>>.

VTOL weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most weapons have a VTOL equivalent, which does approximately twice as much
damage, but has limited ammo. VTOL versions of regular weapons, like cyborgs,
do not need to be researched separately.

In addition to VTOL versions of ground-based direct weapons, VTOLs can also use
image:images/www.png[URL] http://guide.wz2100.net/w/#vtolbombs[bomb weapons].
These weapons are the equivalent of artillery, and are very powerful.

Defending against VTOLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VTOLs are not ground-based units, so most ground weapons cannot hit them. They
an only be hit by either anti-air (often abbreviated AA) (can only hit air) or
versatile (can hit air or ground) weapons.

There are only a few weapons that are versatile: machineguns, lasers, and
Mini-Rocket Pod. Rockets and missiles are also versatile, but only when mounted
on a cyborg or VTOL. In addition to being uncommon, versatile weapons do not do
as much damage to VTOLs as dedicated anti-air, so having some AA is
recommended.

There are three types of dedicated AA. In order of powerfulness, they are: Flak
(Hurricane, Cyclone, Whirlwind), SAM (Avenger, Vindicator), and Stormbringer.

Other orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~

'Patrol': In the Unit Orders box (right-click, remember?), there are a couple of
new icons. Patrol will do the same thing as alt+clicking -- move back and forth
between its current location and the clicked location, and attack anything near
its path, refueling when they need to before returning to defending.

'Circle': In the Unit Orders box, next to Patrol, is the Circle button. Click it
and then click an area of ground, and the selected VTOLs will take off and fly
in a circle above the selected point. Like Patrol, they will attack anything
that gets nearby, and refuel automatically.


Command Panel
-------------

There are six different command panel interfaces, plus a central button. You
open up a command interface by pressing the appropriate button.
|===
|image:images/commandpanel.png[] |F1: <<_manufacturing, Manufacture>>

F2: <<_research, Research>>

F3: <<_building, Build>>

F4: <<_design, Design>>

F5: <<_intelligence_display, Intelligence Display>>

F6: <<_commanders, Commanders>>
|===

The middle button closes any open command interface.

Manufacturing
-------------

Manufacturing units is similar to building structures. The buildings that can
build structures are Factories, Cyborg Factories and VTOL Factories.

image:images/manufacture-select.jpg[]

'Selecting a unit to be manufactured'

image:images/manufacture.jpg[]

'The unit being manufactured'

Building a Unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manufacture a unit, you need to press the Manufacture button. A Fast Find
bar will open at the bottom of the screen, between the radar and the Command
Panel.

The bottom row of the two contains every Factory, Cyborg Factory and VTOL
Factory built. Clicking it will zoom the camera to the structure.

To manufacture a unit, click the space above a factory. If this factory is
capable of building a unit, it will appear in a menu on the left side of the
screen.

A factory can only build a unit if the body of a unit is a certain type
(unit/cyborg/VTOL), and if the factory has enough modules applied.

Queuing Units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can build up to nine units by repeatedly clicking the unit. You can also
right-click the unit to lower the amount of units to build -- right-clicking on
a unit with no units queued will set the queue to 9.

Building Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While a unit is building, the Fast Find bar above the factory building the unit
will be displayed. If the bar is green, the unit is gathering power to build
the unit. If the bar is yellow, the unit is building.

Rally Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the unit is done building, it will spawn next to the factory, then proceed
to a rally point. A rally point is created when a factory is made.
Right-clicking on the factory in the bottom Fast Find row will centre the
camera on a spawn point. Clicking a rally point will allow you to move it in a
similar way to building a structure. Please note that moving a rally point
while a unit is moving to one will not affect its path.

image:images/rallypoints.jpg[]

'Rally points (clockwise, from top left): Cyborg rally point, Factory rally
point, Repair Facility, VTOL rally point'

Looped production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also set looped production by left and right clicking the loop button
in the left column near the top. This repeats the build sequence you set the
amount of times shown next to the button. This can be set to infinite by
right-clicking when the number reads zero.

Research
--------

Researching technologies is very simple. You can only research technologies
with Research Facilities.

image:images/research-select.jpg[]

'Selecting a topic to research'

image:images/research.jpg[]

'The topic being researched'

Researching
~~~~~~~~~~~

Single Player
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the single player game, you collect Artefacts from enemies and research
them. Artefacts are small white boxes with a wrench above them, and can be
collected by any unit by moving to it.

Multiplayer/Skirmish
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Multiplayer/Skirmish games, you progress along a "tech tree" - a couple of
topics can be researched, which in turn will unlock more technologies - also
referred to as progressing 'up the tech tree'.

Researching a topic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you open the Research menu, a Fast Find menu with two rows will appear at
the bottom of the screen. All your research facilities are shown on the second
row. Clicking a research facility will zoom the camera to it.

Clicking the blank icon above a facility will show a set of icons on the left.
You can hold the mouse over an icon to see its name. Click an icon to start
researching it. Only one center can research one technology at a time.

While a facility is researching, it displays a bar in its Fast Find area. If
the bar is green, the facility is gathering power. If it is yellow, the topic
is being researched.

Research Completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When research is completed, the game will inform you by a message and playing a
sound "Research Completed". If it was a major technology advancement, an entry
will be made in the Intelligence Display. You can check the entry for more
information about the research.

Research Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can research a Research Module during the course of the game. To apply it,
select a truck and left click a non-upgraded Research Center, and the truck
will build it. However, the topic you are researching will be stopped until the
module is built - it's your choice to let it build or wait.

Other upgrades are also available for Research Centers, but these don't make
you wait to apply an upgrade to a building.

Building
--------

Building structures is absolutely vital in Warzone - from Factories to build
units, to Research Centers for researching new technology.

Building can be done with units with Trucks as turrets and Combat Engineers.

image:images/building-select.jpg[]

'Selecting a structure to build'

image:images/building.jpg[]

'Selecting an area to build the structure'

Building a Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build, you need to select Build on the Command Panel, and this will bring up
two rows of icons on the bottom of the screen, between the Command Panel and
the Radar. These each represent one unit (either a truck or a Combat Engineer)
that is able to build. Clicking the bottom row of icons will zoom the camera to
the unit. The top row of icons will pull up a bar on the left side of the
screen (diagram 1). The two columns of icons represent the structures you can
build. Click a structure on the columns to select it for building. You can hold
the mouse over an icon to see the structure's name.

Selecting a location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you select a structure, it closes the two menus (like clicking the middle
button). A white square will appear in the world. This is where your structure
will be placed. Move the square by moving the mouse. Click to place the build
site for the structure. If the square is red, the structure cannot be placed.
To build "walls" (when building defenses) you can click and drag the box to
draw a wall.

Oil Derricks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oil derricks can only be built on Oil Pools which aren't on fire. Fires on Oil
Pools will burn out over time. Oil derricks are built automatically if a truck
is selected and you left-click an Oil Pool.

The unit you selected to build the structure will move to build the structure.

If you open the Build menu again, the unit's status will be shown in the Fast
Find bar. If there is a structure without a bar in the Fast Find top row above
a unit, the unit is moving to the build site. If there is a green bar, it is
accumulating power for building. If there is a yellow bar, it is building the
site.

Repairing
~~~~~~~~~

You can assign a unit to repair a structure by selecting it and left-clicking a
building.

Demolishing
~~~~~~~~~~~

Demolishing a building is nearly as simple as building one. Select "Demolish
Structure" in the Structure menu and click a building to demolish. The unit
will move to the building and destroy it, giving you half the power used in
building the structure. Demolish Structure will always be available, from start
of game to end.

Teamwork
~~~~~~~~

You can assign extra trucks/cyborgs to a building to build it faster. Simply
select a unit and left-click a structure, and the unit will move to the
building and start helping construction.

Hardcrete and Tank Traps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may wonder what the Hardcrete and Tank Traps do. Well, they do nothing.
They just sit there and keep your units and enemy units from passing through.


Design
------

You need to design new units and VTOLs if you want to overpower your enemies
and get that sweet taste of victory. This aspect of the game is what makes
Warzone unique in its own way. Note that you need a Command Center to be able
to design units!

image:images/design.jpg[]

'Designing a new unit'

image:images/design-unit.jpg[]

'The unit being designed'

Designing a unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a new unit, select the Design icon in the Command Panel. This will make
two columns appear on the left of the screen. To make a new design, select the
green body. To select another unit to edit, just click it.

Designing a new unit is simple. It's a three-step procedure: selecting a body,
a propulsion system, and a turret. The three picked will result in a new unit.

image:images/design-more.png[]

'Clockwise, from top left: Select a body, propulsion type, turret, and closing
the menu'

Designing the unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a new unit is started, a list of bodies will appear on the right, with a
green outline of a body in the centre. A two-column body list will appear on
the right. Select one to move on to the next section -- the propulsion type.
Select a type and move on to the turret. There are two types of turrets,
weapons and systems. Both are defined at the top of the two-column by buttons
-- you can switch by clicking the respective button. Select a turret, and
you're done.

image:images/design-screen.jpg[]

The top half of the Design (minus completed designs)

1. The name of a unit. You can click this and change it by typing.

2. Click this to change a body of a design.

3. Click this to change a propulsion type of a design.

4. Click this to change a turret of a design.

5. Click this to delete the currently selected design (only works with
completed designs)

6. Power required to make the unit

7. Hit points the unit has

8. Select the System turrets (turret only, normal units only)

9. Select the Weapon turrets (turret only, normal units only)
+
image:images/design-bars.jpg[]

10. How fast the unit moves over roads

11. How fast the unit moves off-road

12. How fast the unit moves over water

13. Weight of the unit (affects the speed and durability of the unit)

Intelligence Display
--------------------

While the Intelligence Display doesn't have a large purpose like the rest of
the functions, it is still very useful indeed - it contains a record of all the
technology you have researched, and your mission objective in Campaign
missions.

image:images/intelligencedisplay.jpg[]

'Intelligence display with piece of intelligence selected'

What's displayed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you open the Intelligence Display, two rows of icons appear on the bottom
of the screen. Selecting an icon will display information in the middle of the
screen. This is helpful for looking at technologies you have researched. During
Campaign, a piece of intelligence always displayed is your mission objective.

We Brake For Nobody
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that while the Intelligence Display pauses the game in Campaign
mode, it doesn't do so in Multiplayer and Skirmish!

Commanders
----------

image:images/commander.png[]

Command turrets are used much like <<_artillery_and_sensors, sensors>>, except
they can command any attacking unit, not just artillery. They are limited to
having 6 non-artillery attacking units assigned to them at first, but this
limit rises by 2 each time the commander gains a rank, which happens relatively
quickly.

Command turrets provide an image:images/www.png[URL]
http://guide.wz2100.net/experience[accuracy, armor, and movement speed bonus]
to all units assigned to them.

image:images/commander-panel.jpg[]

The Commanders panel. Note the similarity to the <<_unit_orders_menu, Unit
Orders panel>>.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commanders require you to research the Commander technology.

Attaching
~~~~~~~~~

To attach a unit to a Commander, select a unit, then left-click the Commander
you want to attach the unit to. A symbol will appear next to the unit to
signify it is attached.

Limits
~~~~~~

Be warned, however; Commanders have a limit to the amount of direct-fire units
(eg machineguns) which is affected by their own experience level. Levels are
earned by the

Commander reaching 2 kills, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and so on. Each experience level
allows the Commander 2 more direct-fire units. However, a Commander can have as
many indirect-fire units as it wants.

Detaching
~~~~~~~~~

To detach a unit from a Commander, select the unit you want to detach, hold the
Control key, and give the unit a new order (eg. move).

Targeting a unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can designate a target by selecting a Commander and right-clicking a unit.
This allows any attached units to have greater accuracy when firing on a
targeted unit.

Commander Unit Command Centre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Commander Unit Command Centre is similar to a Unit Command Centre, but there
are extra buttons.

Factory Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/commander-factory-assignment.jpg[]

'The Commander Factory assignment buttons'

You can assign a factory to a Commander. This makes a factory manufacture units
and automatically assign them to the Commander's group. To do so, bring up the
Commanders menu by left-clicking the Commander and opening the Commanders menu,
or right click the Commander, and click the factory NUMBER at the bottom of the
Command Console.

You can find a factory number by looking at the number on the factory in the
Manufacture Fast Find bar. There are three rows of these numbers -- the top is
normal Factories, middle; Cyborg factories, bottom; VTOL factories.

Going for repairs, BRB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A unit that retreats from the battle to go to a repair facility, will stay
connected to its Commander group. When it is done repairing, it will return to
the Commander.

Indirect fire support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/indirect-fire-support.jpg[]

'The indirect fire support icon'

You can assign all the indirect fire pits and emplacements to a Commander's
designated target, also known as "fire support". To do so, simply select a
Commander, open the Commanders menu, and select the above icon. To cancel it,
select the same button, or assign the fire support to another commander.


Artillery and Sensors
---------------------

As a review, keep in mind that "artillery" here refers to all indirect-fire
weapons except the mini-rocket artillery (MRL) and Angel Missiles, namely:

- Mortars (mortar, bombard, pepperpot, incendiary mortar)
- Howitzers (howitzer, ground shaker, hellstorm, incendiary howitzer)
- Ripple rockets
- Archangel missiles

Although the MRL and Angel Missiles are indirect-fire weapons, they should be
used like one would use direct-fire weapons, since their range is low enough
that its internal sensor can handle it; external sensors are unnecessary.

Sensors
~~~~~~~

image:images/sensor.png[]

Regular sensors can be used for scouting and surveillance, but they have a more
important usage: to spot for artillery.

Using sensors with artillery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Artillery weapons, by themselves, cannot fire more than their sensor range (8
tiles without upgrades). However, even the lowly mortar has an 18-tile weapon
range. To use it, players need to use sensors.

Artillery structures are the easiest. Simply build a sensor tower, and if the
sensor tower is targeting something within your artillery structures' weapon
range, they will fire at it. An artillery tank, however, needs to be explicitly
assigned to a sensor to function. Select the artillery tanks, then click on a
sensor to assign the tank to the sensor.

image:images/artillery-sensor.jpg[]

'Artillery assigned to a sensor. Notice the * next to them, which indicates that
they are assigned.'

Once the artillery is assigned, if it is assigned to a sensor tower, that tower
will target enemies that come in range automatically.

If it is assigned to a sensor tank, the sensor can be used to attack enemies by
selecting the sensor and targeting an enemy. All artillery assigned to the
sensor will attack its target.

image:images/artillery-far-away.jpg[]

'Notice that the artillery can be very far away -- only the sensor turret needs
to get within range.'

To unassign a unit from a sensor, the easiest way is to right-click it, then
tell it to move somewhere. Multiple units can be selected with ctrl+click, and
moving them all.

CB sensors
~~~~~~~~~~

A CB (Counter-Battery) tower or turret is used similarly to a standard sensor;
however, it serves a specialized purpose: To counter-attack enemy artillery.

Normal sensor towers will direct your artillery to attack whatever is nearby,
but CB towers will direct your artillery to attack any artillery attacking you,
even if they are further away from you than other targets. If you have both a
CB tower and a sensor tower, artillery structures will attack CB targets first,
and only other targets once you are no longer being bombarded by enemy
artillery.

A VTOL CB sensor does the same thing, except to VTOLs assigned to it.

Sensor towers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sensor towers and sensor units have several major differences:

- A standard sensor turret has a range of 12; a standard sensor tower has a
range of 16 (special sensor turrets have the same range as their tower).
- A sensor tower cannot be ordered to target something specific; they
automatically target the nearest unit (except CB and VTOL CB towers).
- A sensor turret will not target anything automatically; it must be manually
ordered to attack a target

What counts as a sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Command Center (HQ) is also considered a standard sensor tower, while the
Satellite Uplink Center is also considered a Wide Spectrum sensor tower. In
addition to their usual functionality, they can also be used as the
corresponding sensor tower (for instance, you can assign artillery to them).

Transports
----------

Transports are used during the campaign to transport units from one sector to
another (known as 'Away Missions'). In multiplayer, they're used to transport
cyborgs from one part of the current map to another.

Campaign
~~~~~~~~

Loading Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To load units into a transport, select the desired units and click the
transport. Only 10 units can occupy a transport at one time. The number of
units you have loaded can be seen in the top left of the screen, next to the
launch button.

Opening the Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To open a transport's menu, click the transport itself. In the screenshot, the
menu is open.

The units already in the transport are listed to the right.

Launching a Transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To launch a transport, click the button in the top left corner of the screen.
The transport will launch, and proceed to the destination.

Away Missions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

image:images/awaymission.jpg[]

'Hunkered down at the landing zone.'

Arrival
^^^^^^^

When you arrive at the destination, the transport will drop off the units you
loaded into the transport and fly away.

Normal Base Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During away missions, you can still research, manufacture and design units.
Simply do it as you would normally, and it will happen back in the base area.
You can only build with trucks you have under your control, though. Remember
you're on an away mission, and in some missions, you won't get reinforcements,
so stock well.

Requesting Reinforcements!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On missions where you CAN request reinforcements, the transport button should
be at the top left of the screen. Click it, and you'll see the transport menu,
with one little twist - all the units you left at home alone are on the right
side of the screen.

To load units into the transport, click them, and they'll be moved from the
right side of the screen to the left. To launch, hit the launch button again.
To close this screen, hit the middle button on the Command Panel.

Your units will be on their way. The timer next to the Transport button will
have the time remaining until your units get to your location.

Take Me Home
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your units are on an away mission, they're not going home until the
mission is completed, or you've gotten them killed. I think they'd prefer the
earlier option.

Multiplayer
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of transports in Multiplayer is much more limited in comparison to
Singleplayer.

Cyborg Transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only type of transport available in Multiplayer is the Cyborg Transport. As
you may or may not have guessed by the name, it can only hold Cyborgs, no
normal units or VTOLs allowed. Cyborg Transports can only be built by VTOL
Factories with 2 modules attached, and the technology needs to be researched.

Loading
^^^^^^^

To load a cyborg into the transport, select it and click the Cyborg Transport.
The cyborg will load on.

Moving
^^^^^^

The Cyborg Transport moves like a normal VTOL - select it and click on a piece
of terrain to move it. It will take off and land at the place you selected.

Unloading
^^^^^^^^^

The interface used by the Cyborg Transport is a watered-down version of the
Transport interface. To open it, right click the transport. The cyborgs loaded
on will be displayed on the left. To boot out a cyborg, click it (while landed,
we don't want them falling, do we? :) ).

Destruction
^^^^^^^^^^^

Cyborg Transports have no weapons, and so are sitting ducks for AA turrets and
hardpoints. If a Cyborg Transport is destroyed and it has a few cyborgs on
board, you'll lose them too. So be careful, OK?
