work anymore.

*--cheat*::
      Run in cheat mode.

*--datadir*='DIR'::
      Set default datadir to 'DIR'.

*--debug*='FLAG'::
      Show debug for 'FLAG', use this several times for several flags. Useful
      flags include 'wz', '3d', 'sound', 'video'. 'all' gives all of that and
      much more.

*--debugfile*='FILE'::
      Log debug output in 'FILE'.

*--fullscreen*::
      Play in fullscreen mode.

*--help*::
      Show help and exit.

*--mod*='MOD'::
      Enable global mod 'MOD'.

*--mod_ca*='MOD'::
      Enable campaign only mod 'MOD'.

*--mod_mp*='MOD'::
      Enable multiplay only mod 'MOD'.

*--savegame*='NAME'::
      Load a saved game 'NAME' (needs to include the .gam extension).

*--continue*::
      Continue playing the last saved game, if it exists.

*--window*::
      Play in windowed mode.

*--version*::
      Output version info and exit.

*--resolution*='WIDTHxHEIGHT'::
      Run  at 'WIDTH' times 'HEIGHT' screen resolution. This needs to be a
      resolution supported by your X server.

*--(no)shadows*::
      Toggle the shadows.

*--(no)sound*::
      Toggle the sound.

*--(no)texturecompression*::
      Toggle texture compression (default on). At least on systems where Mesa's
      libtxc-dxtn handles texture compression, loading is slower with it enabled.
      In-game FPS are also higher though.

*--gfxbackend*='BACKEND'::
      Change the graphics backend to 'BACKEND'. Possible backends include:
      'opengl', 'opengles', 'vulkan', 'directx' (Windows only).
      Not all backend options may be available on every system, depending on OS,
      driver support, and whether the game was built with support.

The fullscreen/window, resolution,  sound,  gfxbackend,  and  shadows  settings
are  stored,  so  they  only  need to be specified once, or when you want to
change them.

EXAMPLES
--------
'warzone2100 --fullscreen --resolution=800x600'::
      Run in full screen at 800x600 screen resolution.

'warzone2100 --window --resolution=800x600'::
      Run in a window at 800x600 screen resolution.

'warzone2100'::
      Run the game, with the last used resolution, fullscreen/window, sound and
      shadow settings.

'warzone2100 --gfxbackend=vulkan::
      Run using the Vulkan backend.
